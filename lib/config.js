/**
 * There are two ways to launch Mongo Edit
 * 1) PREFERRED: Using an external config file containing the config object (must be valid javascript!)
 *    This is the preferred method if you cloned the Github repo as you'll be able to update
 *    with a simple git pull with your config staying unchanged
 *    'node server.js config/sampleConfig.js' to use the sample config file provided
 *
 * 2) Alternatively, you can use one of the default configurations by specifying an environment
 *    You can add as many environments as you want, you can find four examples below
 *    Keep in mind that the default configs are reset everytime you get Mongo Edit from Github or npm
 *   'NODE_ENV=theEnv node server.js' to launch in environment 'theEnv'
 *   'node server.js' to launch in the default ('development') environment
 *
 * Whether coming from an external config file or defined here, the exported config object
 * must contain the following properties:
 *   * templatesDir: the directory holding the templates (you shouldn't need to change this)
 *   * pagination: object holding the two parameters (resultsPerPage and pagesAroundCurrent)
 *                 for the pagination (you shouldn't need to change this either)
 *   * svPort: the port on which the Express server will be launched
 *   * trustProxy: set it to true if you are running behind a reverse proxy such as Nginx.
 *                 That should be the case if you use Mongo Edit with your production database
 *                 on a server accessible from the outside (the best and easiest is to secure
 *                 all calls to Mongo Edit by a Basic Auth over SSL).
 *   * db: object holding all the information necessary to connect to your Mongo database:
 *           * host: host on which the database runs (localhost if you run Mongo Edit on the same server as the Mongo instance)
 *           * port: port on which the Mongo instance accepts connections
 *           * name: name of the database to use
 *           * username, password (Optional): if specified, authenticate as the corresponding user
 *                                            if not specified, don't (in that case, Mongo Edit
 *                                            won't work if the Mongo daemon was launched with the --auth option)
